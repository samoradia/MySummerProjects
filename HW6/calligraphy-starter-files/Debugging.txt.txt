A bug I ran into during optimization was that the total values for the times were not correct for any of the test cases. After printing 
the times and calculating what the true time for completion should have been, I realized that the time that was being outputted was 
not accounting for the time of the nodes at the top of the graph, or the ones with no dependancies. I realized this occured because 
I only adding the time in the loop that had first checked to see if the node had any tasks dependant on it. 
To fix this, I added the 
of the task when I initially called the time helper, which was only called on nodes that had no dependencies.
This fixed the time for some of the test cases, but not all of them.
