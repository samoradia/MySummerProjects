A bug I ran into while trying to update generations was that only one cell was being filled, at the max, for any given file that was inputted.
This occured no matter how many cells were filled in prior generations, and at times, no cells at all were filled in the next generation.

In order to sort through the bug, I went into debug mode and set break points before and after the for loop that was responible for counting 
the number of occupied neighboring cells. i did this because I reasoned that the cells were not being occupied because, for some reason,
the code did not put the number of occupied neighboring cells in the range to produce an occupied cell in the next generation.
When I went through the loop, I noticed by counter variable kept increasing for each iteration of the loop,
even though it should have been reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. I realized I never reset the variable to 0 after all the neighboring cells
were checked, and when I added that line, the program updated correctly after each "tick".
